Two overall analyses: Explicit and Implicit

What threshold for the outlier RTs? --> RT distributions, vertical lines at 5/3/1%, 2.5 sd, etc.

Analysis of the percentage of errors or no?
--> check the overall percentage of error
--> plot the distribution of the error percentage per participant to see the outliers with high error rates

They evaluated the correlation: Questionnaires ~ Congruency effect
--> Congruency effect = (For each color) Mean RT congruent - Mean RT incongruent
