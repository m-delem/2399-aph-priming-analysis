## Adjustments

They plotted the effects by congruence and color side by side 
-> do the same for explicit and implicit
-> draw the plot first to create a masterpiece

Add statistics to the figures with ggpubr.
Look up how to represent interactions.
Make the best looking figures ever.

## Correlation analyses

A coherent next step
They evaluated the correlation: Questionnaires ~ Congruency effect
--> Congruency effect = (For each color) Mean RT congruent - Mean RT incongruent

Thus creating a new variable. Which continuous variables to study, and how?
